#libsequence 1.8.3

1.  This release _breaks binary compatibility_ with previous releases.  Programs depending on libsequence will likely need to be recompiled.
2.  New constructor functions were added to Sequence::PolyTable, which breaks binary compatibility.  These new constructors are needed for easier [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/) integration.
